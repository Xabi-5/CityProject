        According to the legend of the foundation of Rome, the name of the city, <em>Roma</em> would come from that of Romulus, the founder and first king.

        Although, it has also been suggested that it could be the other way round, Romulus could come from Roma.
        The most popular hypotheses currently are:
        <ul>
            <li>From <em>Rumon</em> or <em>Rumen</em>, believed to be the archaic name of the Tiber river, and related to greek and latin words terms for water flow</li>
            <li>From Etruscan <em>Ruma</em>, word for teat, referring to the wolf that breastfed Romulus and Remus</li>
        </ul>
        However, the roots of the origin of the name remain uncertain to this day
